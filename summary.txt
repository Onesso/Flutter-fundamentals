To create reusable components we start to use class.

In flutter every widgets and objects. This means that they have their class.

Therefore every width has their class they are instantiation of classes.

Thefore to create a custome width, we will have to follow the same principle, i.e.

we must have our custome class that will be instantiated to form the objest which will be the widget.


the wording/thing before my function name is the return value type of the function.
