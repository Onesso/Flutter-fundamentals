To create reusable components we start to use class.

In flutter every widgets and objects. This means that they have their class.

Therefore every width has their class they are instantiation of classes.

Thefore to create a custome width, we will have to follow the same principle, i.e.

we must have our custome class that will be instantiated to form the objest which will be the widget.


the wording/thing before my function name is the return value type of the function.


Classes that extendes statelesswidget must have a constructor function.

So how do you create a constructor function? you declare it using the class name.

the constructor must pass a key to the parent of what the class is extending and in our case the parent of statelesswidget.
